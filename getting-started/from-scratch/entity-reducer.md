description: Define the initial entity state

# Entity State

In our example we are building the state for the `Customer` entity. As such, we've created a new **customer.state.ts** file located at src/app/state/customer.state.ts.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="customer.state.ts" %}
```typescript
import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';
import { buildState, IEntityState } from '@briebug/ngrx-auto-entity';
import { Customer } from '../models/customer.model';

export const { initialState, selectors, facade: CustomerFacadeBase } = buildState(Customer);

export const {
  selectAll: allCustomers
} = selectors;

export function customerReducer(state = initialState): IEntityState<Customer> {
  return state;
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Import the `buildState` function from the ngrx-auto-entity module. This function builds the initial state and selectors for each entity. Call the function by passing in the Customer entity class \(note, the class must be passed in!\) We use object _destructuring_ on the return type access the `initialState` , `selectors` and `facade` base class from the result of `buildState`.

We can now further _destructure_ the selectors object to map each type of standard selector to model-specific names for import into other modules:

* `selectAll` selects the `Array` of entities
* `selectEntities` selects the `Dictionary` of entities
* `selectIds` selects the `Array` of entity identifiers \(keys\)
* `selectTotal` selects the `number` of entities

Note that retrieving and exporting the selectors are optional if you extract the facade. The facade base class generated by buildState fully encapsulates all of the functionality you will need to interact with your entity state, and we generally recommend only using the facade. Demonstration of how to access selectors directly, such as in the event that you may need to create your own custom selectors, is simply for completeness here.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are additional selectors bundled as part of each custom entity state built by `buildState` that may be mapped to state-specific names. Read more in the advanced documentation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When the selectors object is destructured we alias the selectors with entity-friendly names to avoid naming conflicts.
{% endhint %}

Finally, we define the `customerReducer` function. The reducer function accepts two arguments: `state`, which defaults to the `initialState`, and the `action`. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A reducer function is necessary to configure the NgRX standard `actionsReducer` we defined earlier. For most entities, you will not need to do anything other than return the state passed in, as the `autoEntityMetaReducer` will handle reduction for you. If custom reduction is required for your apps, it may be handled in these reducers.
